# Supply

Supplying tokens to the Const Protocol enables users to earn interest on their digital assets. When tokens are supplied, an acceptable interest rate and lending term are set. The Const system continuously seeks to find borrowers to establish the lending relationship as quickly as possible. The system also displays the recommended interest rate for the rapid establishment of lending.

The interest rates for supplied tokens in the Const Protocol are usually higher than those of a variable-rate protocol's supplier interest rates. This is because the interest rates are set by the suppliers themselves, and there is no rate loss due to the borrow utilization ratio.
