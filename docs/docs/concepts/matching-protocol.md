# Matching protocol

Const is a maching protocol for digital assets lending, based on a set of smart contracts running on EVM compatible blockchains and networks. The Const Protocol enables users to supply their assets to earn, and it also allows other participants to borrow those assets using their own collateral.

The matching feature means the suppliers and borrowers can pick up the interest rate, lending terms and other parameters by themselves. If a supplier's acceptable interest rate is lower or same to a borrower's acceptable interest rate, the lending relationship will be set up. This gives suppliers and borrowers the power of unlimited rate range and more.

The Const Protocol is self-custodial, which means users don't need to keep their digital assets in any smart contracts or pools after the lending relationship - assets will go back to user's wallets directly after the lending. This provides safety to user assets.
