# Repay

Repaying borrowed tokens in the Const Protocol is an important step for assets management. Borrowers can repay using the same tokens they borrowed.

Repayment increases the collateralisation ratio, ensuring adequate collateralization and preventing liquidation. By boosting the collateral relative to what is borrowed, repayment prevents assets from being liquidated and allows borrowers to safely withdraw part of their collateral.

The repayment usually happens after the maturity of the lending. The grace period is 24 hours following the maturity of the lending.
