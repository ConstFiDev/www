# Overview

Const is a decentralised self-custodial matching protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers for lending.

Suppliers provide assets with prefered interest rate to the market and earn, and borrowers can access assets with matched interest rate by providing collateral that exceeds the borrowed amount.
